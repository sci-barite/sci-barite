# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m @sci-barite, aka Rafael, previously a recruitment and business development guy who loved to code, and now a DataOps guy who still loves to code!<br><br>👨‍💻 I develop productivity automations, mainly via Google Apps Script and Chrome Extensions. Watch the vid:<br><br>![Working with Sylph video](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zSQ_aYJ2K_1St3sV.gif)<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, TypeScript, the Google Cloud Platform, Python, and Apache NiFi<br><br>👥 I’m looking to collaborate on... Nothing, yet: got enough to do with my own stuff!<br><br>📖 My main hobby is fiction reading and writing (mainly fantasy and sci-fi) but I also love to write about coding<br><br>🕹️ I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Civilization, and classic 2D console/arcade games<br><br>📫 You can reach me here, or at sybarith.r at g mail.
